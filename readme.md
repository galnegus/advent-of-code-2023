# Advent of Code 2023

Collection of my advent of code 2023 programs

## Tech Stack

Typescript, Node


## Installation

Just need to be able to run typescript programs. Should be able to just open a file in vs code and then use the `ts-node` launcher to run each file.

```bash
npm install
```

To run from terminal it might be needed to globally install ts-node (not sure). If it doesn't work without it, run the below command:
```bash
npm install -g ts-node typescript '@types/node'
```
    
## Usage/Examples

```shell
ts-node day-01-trebuchet
```
